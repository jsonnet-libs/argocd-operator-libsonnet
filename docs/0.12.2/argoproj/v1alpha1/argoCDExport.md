## Fields

```

### fn metadata.withAnnotations

```ts

### fn metadata.withAnnotationsMixin

```ts
withAnnotationsMixin(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn metadata.withClusterName

```ts
withClusterName(clusterName)
```

"The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request."

### fn metadata.withCreationTimestamp

```ts
withCreationTimestamp(creationTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds

### fn metadata.withFinalizers

```ts

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list."

The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.\n\nIf this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).\n\nApplied only if Name is not specified.

### fn metadata.withNamespace

More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces"

For backwards\ncompatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,\nboth fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same\nvalue automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.\nWhen namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,\ndataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.\nThere are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:\n* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef\n  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.\n* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef\n  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is\n  specified.\n* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects\n  in any namespaces.\n(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.\n(Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled."
